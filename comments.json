	"text": "Breath of the Wild is my favorite open world game because of little details like this. But as a Zelda game it is a bit lacking. The best part of a Zelda game for me are the dungeons and you don't really have those here. The Devine Beasts are fun but way too short and the same is true for the shrines. But imagine what they can do with BotW 2 now that they have the first game as a baseline and can fully concentrate on the level design!",
