    "text": "I wasn’t expecting anything. What happened is that playing hours of Skyrim on PC fulfilled anything this game could have done for me. I mean, I had already been on Skyrim for 6 years, Oblivion for a number of years before that, and Morrowind for a few years before Oblivion. So by the time BOTW came out, I think I had played open world RPGs for about 12 years! I really wasn’t expecting much out of it, but I did catch the reveal to see if it innovated open worlds or not. So when I saw the reveal, watched gameplay, and saw how basically annoying it looked with the constant text pop ups and weird Nintendo quirks, I knew it wasn’t for me and have never been interested. I’m not a fan of Nintendo’s weird, post-Ocarina of Time quirkiness.",
